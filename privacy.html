    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: March 2026</p>

    <div class="card">
      <strong>Short version:</strong><br />
      Picksy does not collect, store, or share personal data. The app works completely offline.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Picksy is a lightweight random generator app designed for fun, quick decisions, and group games. We respect your privacy and built the app with a strict privacy-first
      approach.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Picksy does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No account system</li>
      <li>No analytics tracking</li>
      <li>No advertising identifiers</li>
      <li>No cookies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      All generated content (history, favorites, custom lists, settings, language preferences) is stored locally on your device only using secure on-device storage. This data never
      leaves your device and can be deleted by uninstalling the app.
    </p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Optional Pro features are offered via in-app purchases. Payments are processed securely by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Play Store</li>
      <li>Apple App Store</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not receive, store, or process payment information. Payment handling is governed by the respective store's privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Picksy does not integrate analytics tools, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies. The only third-party services involved are the official app distribution platforms for
      payment processing.
    </p>

    <h2>6. External Links</h2>
    <p>The app may contain optional links to external websites such as GitHub or Buy Me a Coffee. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of external websites.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Picksy does not knowingly collect personal data from children. Since no personal data is collected at all, the app is safe to use for general audiences.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights (EEA / GDPR)</h2>
    <p>As Picksy does not collect or process personal data, there is no personal information stored that can be accessed, corrected, or deleted.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated in the future. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
